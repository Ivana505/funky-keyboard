### Bugs

#### Solved
- During the process of creating the website there were bugs where the page would crash due to incorrect path. Paths are corrected and images are displaying.

#### Unsolved bugs
During the regular check up of the Webpage I have noticed favicon.com error. 
When investigating with our Slack community I have tried to fix the issue by adding favicon.ico to my website and adding link href (<link href="./readme/favicon.ico" rel="icon" type="image/x-icon">)to head of html but it did not fix it.
I have also tried to follow reccommendations from [Github](https://github.com/) Community [here](https://github.community/t/i-have-no-idea-what-the-interest-cohort-is/179780/8) but nothing seem to fix this bug.<br>
